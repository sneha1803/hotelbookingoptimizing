## Actionable Insights
-  The average daily rate varies dynamically based on the booking demand. However, thereâ€™s still room for improvement by aligning these curves more closely.

-  Targeted incentives for the top 5 agents and companies, such as exclusive offers on hotel services and dining, can stimulate bookings and enhance customer satisfaction.

-  With a current occupancy rate of 62% and agents driving 68% of bookings, diversifying market segments could increase occpuancy & spur further growth.
  
- When it comes to reservations, cancelled ones tend to linger on waiting lists significantly longer than non-cancelled reservations. On average, cancelled reservations spend approximately 2.3 times more time waiting. We need to streamline booking processes, to avoid such long waits.
  
- Among the various room types, Room Type A stands out with a cancellation rate of 44%. Out of the 74,000 bookings made for this room type, approximately 32,000 were cancelled
