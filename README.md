# Hotel Performance Analysis: Evaluating Current State & Delivering Actionable Insights

As an industry with a rapid ebb & flow of demand, operating within highly seasonal patterns, flexibility is at the core of the hospitality industry.

Having a finger on the pulse is not only visionary but vital for a hotel's survival. Achieving this heightened awareness of customer demands & business needs requires routine & rigouorus data anaylsis

## The Challenge
The primary challenge is the significant revenue loss due to cancellations, amounting to ₹4.5 million. This issue is critical as it represents more than half of our total revenue, highlighting an area that requires immediate attention and strategic solutions.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
- **Occupancy**: This KPI measures the percentage of available rooms that are occupied at any given time. It provides a direct insight into how well the hotel is filling its rooms, which is crucial for revenue optimization.
- **ADR (Average Daily Rate)**: The ADR represents the average revenue earned per occupied room per day. It is a vital metric for understanding pricing strategies and their effectiveness.
- **RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room)**: This KPI is calculated by dividing the total room revenue by the number of available rooms. It combines both room occupancy and room rate, providing a comprehensive view of revenue performance.
- **Realization**: This metric measures the actual revenue earned compared to the potential revenue, helping to identify gaps and opportunities for revenue improvement.
- **Average Length of Stay**: This metric tracks the average duration of guest stays, providing insights into guest behavior and potential areas for enhancing guest experience and retention.

## Actionable Insights
-  The average daily rate varies dynamically based on the booking demand. However, there’s still room for improvement by aligning these curves more closely.

-  Targeted incentives for the top 5 agents and companies, such as exclusive offers on hotel services and dining, can stimulate bookings and enhance customer satisfaction.

-  With a current occupancy rate of 62% and agents driving 72% of bookings, diversifying market segments could increase occpuancy & spur further growth.
  
- When it comes to reservations, cancelled ones tend to linger on waiting lists significantly longer than non-cancelled reservations. On average, cancelled reservations spend approximately 2.3 times more time waiting. We need to streamline booking processes, to avoid such long waits.
  
- Among the various room types, Room Type A stands out with a cancellation rate of 44%. Out of the 74,000 bookings made for this room type, approximately 32,000 were cancelled
