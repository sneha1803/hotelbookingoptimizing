Having a thumb on the pulse is not only visionary but vital for a hotel's survival. Achieving this heightened awareness of customer demands and business needs requires routine and rigouorus data anaylsis

I’ve employed MySQL for data cleaning and analysis, followed by additional analysis and subsequent visualization of various business metrics using Power BI.

## Actionable Insights
-  The average daily rate varies dynamically based on the occupancy percentage. However, there’s still room for improvement by aligning these curves more closely.

-  The Top 5 Agents & Companies can be incentivized to increase business by providing offers on in-hotel services & eateries, exclusively to the customers of these channels. This targeted approach can encourage more bookings and enhance customer satisfaction
  
-  Given the current occupancy rate of 62% and the significant contribution of travel agents (accounting for approximately 68% of all bookings), it’s essential to explore other market segments for business growth.
  
- When it comes to reservations, cancelled ones tend to linger on waiting lists significantly longer than non-cancelled reservations. On average, cancelled reservations spend approximately 2.3 times more time waiting.
  
- Among the various room types, Room Type A stands out with a cancellation rate of 44%. Out of the 74,000 bookings made for this room type, approximately 32,000 were cancelled
