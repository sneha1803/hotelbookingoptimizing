# Hotel Performance Analysis: Evaluating Current State & Delivering Actionable Insights

As an industry with a rapid ebb & flow of demand, operating within highly seasonal patterns, flexibility is at the core of the hospitality industry.

Having a finger on the pulse is not only visionary but vital for a hotel's survival. Achieving this heightened awareness of customer demands & business needs requires routine & rigouorus data anaylsis

## The Challenge
Apart from our primary challenge of optimizing revenue and other key performance metrics, a significant secondary challenge is the revenue loss due to cancellations, which amounts to â‚¹4.5 million. This issue is critical as it represents more than half of our total revenue, underscoring the need for immediate attention and strategic solutions.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
- **Occupancy**: This KPI measures the percentage of available rooms that are occupied at any given time. It provides a direct insight into how well the hotel is filling its rooms, which is crucial for revenue optimization.
- **ADR (Average Daily Rate)**: The ADR represents the average revenue earned per occupied room per day. It is a vital metric for understanding pricing strategies and their effectiveness.
- **RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room)**: This KPI is calculated by dividing the total room revenue by the number of available rooms. It combines both room occupancy and room rate, providing a comprehensive view of revenue performance.
- **Realization**: This metric measures the actual revenue earned compared to the potential revenue, helping to identify gaps and opportunities for revenue improvement.
- **Average Length of Stay**: This metric tracks the average duration of guest stays, providing insights into guest behavior and potential areas for enhancing guest experience and retention.

## Actionable Insights
-  While city hotels adeptly adjust their prices in response to demand, Resort Hotels must embrace dynamic pricing strategies to significantly boost their revenue

-  For our Resort Hotels, given our current occupancy rate of just 23.78%, we have a prime opportunity to position our hotel as the go-to choice for last-minute bookings, especially considering our tourist-friendly locations

-  Targeted incentives for the top 5 agents and companies, such as exclusive offers on hotel services and dining, can stimulate bookings and enhance customer satisfaction.

-  With a current occupancy rate of 62% and agents driving 72% of revenue, diversifying market segments could increase occpuancy & spur further growth.
  
- In city hotels, cancelled reservations tend to remain on waiting lists much longer than those that are not cancelled. On average, they spend about 2.3 times more time waiting. To reduce these extended wait times, we need to streamline the booking processes in city hotels.
  
- At City Hotel, Room Type A has an exceptionally high cancellation rate of 87.4%.  Out of the 30K bookings made, over 26K were cancelled.
